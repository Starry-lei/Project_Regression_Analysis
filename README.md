# Project_Regression_Analysis
Dear reader,
When you want to run the 'Model_function_C60.m' file,please give its local path to Matlab`s access path,which is at the fifth line.

And if you want to use these files to calculate values of another two kinds of materials, just change the lines which are be commented.

Thanks for your reading!
